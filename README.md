## Abstract
<p> Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a growing health burden, with hemodialysis being a critical intervention for patients with end-stage renal disease. Effective management of hemodialysis patients requires continuous monitoring to address complications such as acute kidney injury, hypotension, arteriovenous (AV) fistula obstruction, infections, and cardiovascular stress. A comprehensive approach is essential, including personalized treatments such as anemia management, strict control of comorbid conditions like intradialytic hypotension and diabetes, and pharmacological optimization, including the precise dosing of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Additionally, lifestyle modifications play a crucial role in improving patient status. </p>

<p> This project aims to develop an <b>AI-powered patient management system for the Renal Care Unit at Teaching Hospital Peradeniya. </b> By integrating AI and ML, the system will enable real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and clinical decision support, enhancing treatment outcomes. Furthermore, the system will include software for recording medical parameters such as lab reports and hemodialysis-specific data. This digital approach will reduce paper usage in the ward and facilitate easy access to patient data, improving overall efficiency in patient management. </p>
